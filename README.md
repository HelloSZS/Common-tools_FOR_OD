# common_tools_in_OD

### For the convenience to find tools about Object Detection, I decide to upload my usual tools on github.

#### First tools: “check_xml_has_empty.py”

“check_xml_has_empty.py” which is written to find if there is any empty ".xml" file in designative path.


#### Second tools: “1VOC划分训练集测试集.py”
"1VOC划分训练集测试集.py", for split Pascal VOC dataset to train_set and val_set.

#### Third tools: “2生成图片与xml目录映射文档.py”
"2生成图片与xml目录映射文档.py", for generate image_path-xml_path pair path word string and put them into a 'txt' file, it is obliged, because the need of DataLoader to read image and label to train models on follow-up.
